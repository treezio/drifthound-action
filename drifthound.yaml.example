# DriftHound Configuration File
# This file defines drift detection scopes for your infrastructure

# IMPORTANT: Environment-Based Authentication
# When working with multiple environments (dev, staging, prod), you need to handle
# authentication separately per environment in your workflow. See examples below.

# Set the tool used across your repository
# Most repositories use a single tool - specify it here once
default_tool: terraform  # terraform | opentofu | terragrunt

# Optional: Specify tool versions (or omit for latest)
tool_versions:
  terraform: "1.6.0"
  # opentofu: "1.6.0"       # Alternative to Terraform
  # terragrunt: "0.54.0"    # Terragrunt requires either terraform or opentofu

# Define scopes - each scope represents a drift check to perform
scopes:
  # Production Environment Scopes
  # These should be run with production credentials
  - name: "core-infrastructure-prod"
    project: "my-app"
    environment: "production"
    directory: "./terraform/core"
    slack_channel: "#infra-alerts"

  - name: "networking-prod"
    project: "my-app"
    environment: "production"
    directory: "./terraform/networking"
    slack_channel: "#infra-alerts"

  - name: "database-prod"
    project: "my-app"
    environment: "production"
    directory: "./terraform/database"
    slack_channel: "#infra-alerts"

  # Staging Environment Scopes
  # These should be run with staging credentials
  - name: "core-infrastructure-staging"
    project: "my-app"
    environment: "staging"
    directory: "./terraform/core"
    slack_channel: "#dev-alerts"

  - name: "networking-staging"
    project: "my-app"
    environment: "staging"
    directory: "./terraform/networking"
    slack_channel: "#dev-alerts"

  # Development Environment Scopes
  # These should be run with development credentials
  - name: "core-infrastructure-dev"
    project: "my-app"
    environment: "development"
    directory: "./terraform/core"

  # Example: Override the default tool for a specific scope
  # This scope uses Terragrunt while the rest use the default_tool (terraform)
  - name: "multi-region-dev"
    project: "my-app"
    environment: "development"
    directory: "./terragrunt/multi-region"
    tool: "terragrunt"  # Override: use terragrunt for this specific scope

# Workflow Pattern: Environment-Based Jobs
#
# To handle different credentials per environment, structure your workflow like this:
#
# jobs:
#   drift-check-production:
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     steps:
#       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
#       - name: Configure AWS for Production
#         uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
#         with:
#           role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_PROD_ROLE }}
#       - uses: drifthoundhq/drifthound-action@v1
#         with:
#           drifthound-url: ${{ secrets.DRIFTHOUND_URL }}
#           drifthound-token: ${{ secrets.DRIFTHOUND_TOKEN }}
#           environment: production  # Simple! Just specify the environment
#
#   drift-check-staging:
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     steps:
#       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
#       - name: Configure AWS for Staging
#         uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
#         with:
#           role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_STAGING_ROLE }}
#       - uses: drifthoundhq/drifthound-action@v1
#         with:
#           drifthound-url: ${{ secrets.DRIFTHOUND_URL }}
#           drifthound-token: ${{ secrets.DRIFTHOUND_TOKEN }}
#           environment: staging  # Simple! Just specify the environment
#
# This pattern ensures each environment job uses the correct credentials.
